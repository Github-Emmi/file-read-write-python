# 🖋️ File Read & Write Challenge with Error Handling

This Python project reads the contents of a file, modifies it, and writes the updated content to a new file. It includes error handling to catch issues like missing files or read/write problems.

## 💡 What It Does

- Prompts the user for a filename
- Handles missing or unreadable files with friendly error messages
- Reads the file content
- Converts the content to uppercase (or modify as needed)
- Writes the modified content to a new file (`modified_filename.txt`)

## 🧠 Example

**Input File (`example.txt`)**
